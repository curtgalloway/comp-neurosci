Descriptive model: 
What

Descriptive models summarize large amounts of experimental data compactly yet accurately, thereby characterizing what 
neurons and neural circuits do.  These models may be based loosely on biophysical, anatomical, and physiological findings,
but their primary purpose is to describe phenomena, not to explain them. 
--
Mechanistic model:
How
Mechanistic models are designed to show how a neural system goes about accomplishing a particular function.

Mechanistic models, on the other hand, address the question of how nervous systems operate on the
basis of known anatomy, physiology, and circuitry. Such models often form a bridge between descriptive models
couched at different levels.

Interpretive Model:
Why

Interpretive models use computational and information-theoretic principles to explore the behavioral and conitive significance of
various aspects of nervous system function, addressing the question of why nervous systems operate as they do.

Neuron - ~25µm 

Neuron Doctrine: 
*) The neuron is the fundamental structral & functional unit of the brain
*) Neurons are discrete cells and not continuous with other cells
*) Information flows from the dendrites to the axon via the cell body

--
Dendrites are the input ends of the neuron, wheras axons are the output ends
--
Spikes ( output) from a neuron occur when:
The sum of inputs from neighboring neurons reaches a certain threshold.
--

Other neurons' outputs cause some of this neuron's gates to open and allow in a diffferent concentration of 
ions, which leads to a strong depolarization and increases the chance of a spike. 

Inputs from other neurons -> 
Strong enough depolarization causes a spike or 'action potential' 

Strong depolarization opens Na+ ( Sodium ) channels causing rapid Na+ influx 


Ionic channels - gated:
Voltage-gated:
  Probability of opening depends on membrane voltage
Chemically-gated:
   Binding to a chemical causes channel to open
Mechanically-gated:
  Sensitive to pressure or stretching

Synapse: Junction between neurons
  Electrical synapses: use gap junctions
  Chemical synapses: use neurotransmitters
  
Electrical synapses - bidirectional, fast, no gain
Chemical synapses - asymetrical, slower, gain possible, use neurotransmitters

XXXX
False: a chemical synapse is used for smooth coordination of  several neurons, whereas 
the electrical synapse is used for applications in which a customized amount of current
transmission is desired between neurons upon spiking, such as in building memories. 
XXXX

The chemical synapses are those more predominantly used in things like memory formation 
as these chemicals also have the ability to alter synaptic interactions in the synaptic cleft,
whereas electrical synapses are a means by which networks of neurons  can coordinate, and in some cases
synchronize their outputs.

Synapses can be Excitatory or Inhibitory

Excitatory synapses increase postsynaptic membrane potential ( EPSP - excitatory postsynaptic potential )
Inhibitory synapses decrease postsynaptic membrane potential ( IPSP - inhibitory postsynaptic potential )

Chemical synapses are thought to be basis for memory and learning. 

-Synaptic Plasticity 

Hebbian Plasticity: If neuron A repeatedly takes part in firing neuron B, then the synapse 
                    from A to B is strengthened. 
"Neurons that fire together wire together"

LTP: Long term potentiation - 
     Experimentally observed incease in synaptic strength that lasts for hours or days

LTD: Long term depression
     Experimentally observed decrease in synaptic strength that lasts for hours or days

Peripheral Nervous System ( PNS ) 
- Somatic: Nerves connecting to voluntary skeletal muscles and sensory receptors
  -- Afferent Nerve Fibers ( incoming ) : Axons that carry info PNS => CNS
  -- Efferent Nerve Fibers ( outgoing ) : Axons that carry info CNS => PNS 

- Autonomic: Nerves that connect to the heart, blood vessels, smooth muscles, and glands

Central Nervous System ( CNS ) : Spinal Cord + Brain
- Spinal Cord: 
  -- Local feedback loops control reflexes ( "reflex arcs" ) 
  -- Descending motor control signals from the brain activate spinal motor neurons 
  -- Ascending sensory axons convey sensory information from muscles and skin back to the brain 

- Brain

 -The Hindbrain
 -- Medulla Oblongata: Breathing, muscle tone and blood pressure
 -- Pons: Connected to the cerebellum & involved in sleep & arousal 
 -- Cerebellum: Coordination and timing of voluntary movements, sense of equilibrium, language, attention

 -Midbrain & Reticular Formation 
 --Midbrain - Eyemovements, visual and auditory reflexes 
 --Reticular Formation - Modulates muscle reflexes, breathing & pain perception. Also regulates sleep, wakefulness & arousal

 -Thalamus & Hypothalamus
 --Thalamus - Relay station for all sensory info ( excpet smell ) to the cortex, regulates sleep/wakefulness
 --Hypothalamus - Regulates basic needs - ( "4 Fs" ): Fighting, Fleeing, Feeding, and Frackin' 

 -The Cerebrum - Involved in perception and motor control, cognitive functions, emotion, memory, and learning
 --Cerebal cortex
 --Basal ganglia
 --Hippocampus
 --Amygdala

Details on Cerebral Cortex: A Layerred Sheet of Neurons
- Convoluted surfce of cerebrum, about 1/8th of an inch thick
  --Approximately 30 billion neurons
  --Each neuron makes about 10,000 synapses, approximately 300 trillion connections in total

- Six layers of neurons
  --Relatively uniform in structure
  --Is there a common computational principle operating across cortex?  ** unanswered question ** 

How do all of these brain regions interact to produce cognition and behavior? 
** we don't know!! **

fMRI : measured by blood flow to areas of the brain where neurons are active - time measured in seconds
EEG  : faster response time - catches electrical fields directly 

Downside to both methhods: Neither gives as clean a signal as we would like with respect to temporal and spatial resolution.

Electrode array: can measure from a single neuron 
Calcium imaging: Calcium enters into the cell during action potentials - so measuring calcium measures which are active 

The definition of a strong response in this context is one where a particular cell fires very reliably to a particular feature of the stimulus so that every time it occurs ( throughout the stimulus or across iterations ) the cell fires. 

Encoding: P( response | stimulus ) 
Decoding: P( stimulus | response ) 
response - spike 
What is the stimulus? We  don't know. 

---
Tuning curves are built around the ideal stimulus of the cell. That is, the particular attribute of a stimulus, light bar orientation in this case, that causes an optimal firing rate ( say 45 degrees). This point corresponds to the peak of the Gaussian tuning curve, while the spread, or width , of the curve corresponds to the range ( say 40-50 degrees) that still elicit a response from the cell, but a lesser one. As such, we generally conduct tuning curve experiments on cell types we have already indentified to find the particular attribute(s) of a stimulus that the cell prefers. 

At each successive step up through the visual system, the cells respond preferentially to more and more complex shapes ( and even ideas) as a result of the differential firing patterns of spikes within the layers below them that are being fed upward. Inter-connectivity between each of the layers also plays a major role.
